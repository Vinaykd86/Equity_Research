Project Overview:This project present's a comprehensive financial analysis and valuation exercise of Happiest minds  aimed at estimating a company's intrinsic value and offer investment recommendations on whether to buy, sell, or hold the stock.. The methods used include both discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation through Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) and Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) calculations, as well as relative valuation using multiples like the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio.Valuation is done with the help of 3 statement linked financial model.The model includes a detailed revenue forecast , a capital expenditure (Capex) model, a debt schedule for tracking borrowing and repayment, and a working capital model for managing current assets and liabilities. Using these components, the model generates an accurate cash flow statement, helping assess liquidity and cash generation.

Components Description:

Revenue Model: The revenue model forecasts Eicher Motors' sales based on historical data and projected growth drivers, segmented by business lines.

Schedules_populated:

1.Capex Model: A detailed capital expenditure model, estimating the company's future investments in fixed assets to sustain and grow operations.

2.Debt Schedule: A comprehensive debt schedule that tracks the company's borrowing, repayment schedule, and interest expense calculations.

3.Working Capital Model: This model forecasts the company's working capital requirements, focusing on key components such as inventory, receivables, and payables.

Assumptions: Contains critical assumptions that drive the financial model, such as growth rates, discount rates, and capital expenditure forecasts.

WACC: Shows the calculations for the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, which is used to discount future cash flows in the DCF model.

FCFF: Outlines the calculation of Free Cash Flow to the Firm, which is a key component of the DCF analysis to estimate the firm's value.

Relative Valuation: Focuses on a P/E-based relative valuation, comparing the firm's P/E ratio to that of peer companies (like EPAM and Globant). It indicates a market-based perspective to complement the intrinsic valuation.
